    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <p>Marinate the chicen well: Allow the chicken to marinate in yogurt and spices for at least an hour, or preferably longer, to ensure it absorbs all the flavours. This step adds depth of flavour to the dish.</p>
    <p>Layering is key: Layering the partially cooked rice over the cooked chicken masala creates layers of flavor. Ensure the rice is cooked just about 70-8-% before layering it over the chicken. This allows the rice to finish cooking with the steam from the chicken. Resulting in perfectly cooked grains.</p>
    <p>Use Quality Ingredients: Quality ingredients, especially aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, and saffron, can greatly enhance the taste of your briyani. Fresh herbs like coriander and mint also add a burst of freshness to the dish. Don't skimp on these, as they play a crucial role in the overall flavor profile of the briyani.</p>
