    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <p>Use bone-in chicken: Using bone-in chicken pieces, such as thighs or drumsticks, adds depth of flavor to the gravy. The bones releasegelatin as they cook, Resulting in a richer and more flavorful sauce.</p>
    <p>Saute the spices: Toasting whole spices like cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and cardamom pods in oil or ghee before adding other ingredients can enhance the aroma and flavor of the gravy. Be careful not to burn them, as it can make the gravy bitter.</p>
    <p>Incorporate aromatics: Adding aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, and ginger at the beginning of cooking creates a flavorful base for the gravy. Saute them until they are soft and golden brown to enhance their sweetness and depth of flavor.</p>
