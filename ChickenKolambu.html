    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Marinate the chicken: Marinating the chicken in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and spices for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight, will enhance the flavor and tenderness of the chicken.</p>
    <p>Use freshly ground spices: Grinding whole spices such as coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and fenugreek seeds just before adding them to the dish will release their essential oils and provide a more aromatic and flavorful kolambu.</p>
    <p>Balance the flavours: Achieve a perfect balance of flavors by adjusting the amount of spice, tanginess, and saltiness to suit your taste preferences. Taste the kolambu as it cooks and make adjustments as needed to ensure a well-balanced and delicious dish.</p>
